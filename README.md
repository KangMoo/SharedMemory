SharedMemory
============

This is a project written for java and c that allows two processes to share information between them across posix memory.

There is a c folder that also includes the jni bindings for the Java.  The Java is a Netbeans project.

To run, cd into the c directory and run the compile script.  You will probably have to edit the script to point to where your java is loaded.
At some point I will make this easier, this is still very early code.
